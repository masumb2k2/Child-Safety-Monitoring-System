# 👶 Child Safety Surveillance System

## 📖 Overview
The **Child Safety Surveillance System** is an advanced **AI-powered monitoring solution** that uses **YOLO object detection** and **computer vision** to detect potential safety hazards for children in **real-time**.  
The system analyzes live or recorded video feeds to identify dangerous situations and immediately alerts caregivers.

## 🎯 Key Problem Solved
Traditional surveillance systems require **constant human monitoring**, which is time-consuming and error-prone.  
This system **automates threat detection** for common child safety scenarios, including:

- 🔪 Children accessing **dangerous objects** (e.g., knives, scissors)
- 🔥 Unsupervised proximity to **hazards** (fire, stairs)
- 🚪 **Suspicious movement patterns** near exits
- 🚫 Children alone in **restricted areas**
